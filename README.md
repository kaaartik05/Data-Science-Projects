# Student Performance Analysis using Machine Learning

This project analyzes a student performance dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a student will pass or fail using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (average score, pass/fail)
- One-hot encoding of categorical data
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance visualization

## Dataset:
- [Students Performance on Exams - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results:
- Achieved XX% accuracy with Random Forest
- Identified key predictors of student performance
